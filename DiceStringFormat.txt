Dice String Format
A document specifying the format to communicate dice rolls.

CONSTANTS:
Adding constants to a dice string is simple. Simply type the constant.
Example: "9" evaluates to 9.

DICE:
Dice are specified using the common RPG specifying system. The format is <number_of_dice_to_roll>d<sides_of_dice>
Example: "3d6" means "roll three six-sided dice and sum the values"

OPERATIONS:
The only supported operations are "+" and "-". Any number of dice and constants can be chained in this way.
Example: "3d6+5"

COMPARISONS:
Use comparisons to specify a fail/win state. The following comparisons are accepted: "<", ">", and "=". The results of a fail/win state depend on the circumstance.
Example: "3d6+5>9" Means that a certain condition should be executed if the sum of three dice rolls of a six-sided die and 5 is greater than 9.
